          Beneath the glossy veneer of this impressively professional website is a human being known as 
          Joe. I have visited and travelled in dozens of countries. I play the piano and the guitar and 
          I sing and write songs and produce music. I’ve written scores of poems and short stories and 
          I’ve contributed them to small publications. I lived in East Germany for 14 months, Vietnam 
          for 3, Thailand for 3, France for 5. I’ve driven motorbikes but never a car. I speak French and 
          Spanish conversationally and German comically. When I want to exercise, I run, when I want to 
          think, I walk, when I want to relax, I sit and when I want to feel happy, I cook a big vegan 
          meal for whoever’s nearby.
